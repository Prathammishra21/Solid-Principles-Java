The Interface Segregation Principle (ISP) in Java emphasizes that clients should not be forced to depend on interfaces
they do not use. It encourages creating cohesive interfaces that contain only the methods relevant to the implementing
classes. This principle helps in avoiding unnecessary dependencies and ensures that implementing classes remain
focused on their specific responsibilities. In Java, ISP is implemented by defining multiple smaller interfaces
tailored to the needs of different clients, rather than a single large interface. This allows classes to implement
only the interfaces that are relevant to them, promoting cleaner and more maintainable code.
